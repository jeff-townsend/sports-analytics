# sports-analytics
this is my sports analytics repo. for now, I'm going to tag the particular sport in front of the file name to organize by sport as opposed to having a separate repo for each sport. currently, my goal is to build out data that helps improve my understanding of the sport itself and create team-level context/insights when watching games.
